# Heddy-OS
#### By Mathias Hedberg
A set of libraries and main file, to run a basic OS on the ATmega32 with an LCD.
The system uses a custom LCD library for a 16x2 LCD display, te parameters for the pins must at this stage, be defined in the .h file it self.
A menu for viewing the brightness level via ADC is in progress.

Fell free to branch this project.
